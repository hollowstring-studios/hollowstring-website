    Founded in 2025, Hollowstring Studios emerged from the rebranding of Orthos Studios. The original studio, also established by the same three founders, initially developed both games and applications. However, this dual focus led to significant challenges, including project delays and team fragmentation.
    <br><br>
    As Orthos Studios grew, it began to lose its creative focus, becoming more corporate in nature. Recognizing this, the founders decided to restructure and refocus their vision. Thus, Hollowstring Studios was born.
    <br><br>
    Hollowstring Studios is a dedicated indie game studio, returning to the founders' original passion for creating immersive and enjoyable gaming experiences. Our focus is not solely on financial success, but on the creative satisfaction that comes from building games we love. We are a small, passionate team committed to crafting unique and engaging worlds for our players.
